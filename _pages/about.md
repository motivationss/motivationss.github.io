About Me
======
---

I'm a first-year PhD student in Computer Science at University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, working under the supervision of [Hanghang Tong](http://tonghanghang.org/). Prior to this, I earned my bachelor’s degree from the University of Michigan. My recent research interests lie primarily on the science of large language models and representation learning.
